# Hi, I'm Santiago 👋

- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm a passionate Fullstack Developer with experience in personal and academic projects. My focus spans both the client and server sides, enabling me to create comprehensive applications. I've gained a strong grasp of current technologies. I've tackled technical challenges and demonstrated quick learning skills in my personal projects. Now, I'm seeking to join a professional team to apply my expertise and continue growing as a developer.

- 🌱 Currently, I am engaged in carrying out projects that allow me to progress in my training as a programmer. I am immersed in learning Next.js and the Prisma ORM to enhance my technical skills.
- 🎯 My goal is to make an impact in the world of programming. I love programming, not only for its wide variety of technologies, but also for everything that can be achieved, since the only limitation is our own logic.

- HTML, CSS, SASS, Tailwindcss.
- JavaScript, Typescript, React, Redux.
